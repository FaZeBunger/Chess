### Overview

This repo is my attempt at learning how to work on projects through github,
manage versions, and attempt something slightly more difficult than that
which I had previously been working on.

If you have ideas or suggestions for any improvements, all help is welcome.
I still have a lot to learn but am hoping to learn how to make scaleable
and easy to understand code.
